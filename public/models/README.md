Place your GLB/GLTF models here, then set the environment variables in `.env.local`:

NEXT_PUBLIC_HAND_MODEL_URL=/models/hand_skin.glb
NEXT_PUBLIC_HAND_BONES_URL=/models/hand_bones.glb
NEXT_PUBLIC_HAND_BONES_URL=/models/JustBones617_0_resaved_1_NIH3D.glb

Recommended sources for high‑quality, license‑friendly anatomy models:
- Z-Anatomy (Open anatomy models): https://github.com/Z-anatomy/Z-anatomy
- Sketchfab (filter by downloadable + CC BY/CC0): https://sketchfab.com/search?features=downloadable&q=human%20hand%20bones
- NIH 3D Print Exchange: https://3dprint.nih.gov/collections/anatomy

Use GLB/GLTF where possible. If you get OBJ/FBX, convert to GLB via Blender and apply proper scale/origin.
